<h1>Python Function</h1>
<P><font size="5">Functions are the most important aspect of an application. A function can be defined as the organized block of reusable code, which can be called whenever required.

Python allows us to divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as a function. The function contains the set of programming statements enclosed by {}. A function can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the Python program.

The Function helps to programmer to break the program into the smaller part. It organizes the code very effectively and avoids the repetition of the code. As the program grows, function makes the program more organized.

Python provide us various inbuilt functions like range() or print(). Although, the user can create its functions, which can be called user-defined functions.
<P>There are mainly two types of functions.

User-define functions - The user-defined functions are those define by the user to perform the specific task.
Built-in functions - The built-in functions are those functions that are pre-defined in Python.</font>
<h2>Creating a Function</h2>
<P>Python provides the def keyword to define the function. The syntax of the define function is given below.
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<P>def my_function(parameters):  
      <P>function_block  
<P>return expression
<h2>Function Calling</h2>
<p><font size="5">In Python, after the function is created, we can call it from another function. A function must be defined before the function call; otherwise, the Python interpreter gives an error. To call the function, use the function name followed by the parentheses.
</font>
<h2>The return statement</h2>
<p><font size="5">The return statement is used at the end of the function and returns the result of the function. It terminates the function execution and transfers the result where the function is called. The return statement cannot be used outside of the function.
<p>syntax
<P>return [expression_list]  
</font>
<h2>Arguments in function</h2>
<P><font size="5">The arguments are types of information which can be passed into the function. The arguments are specified in the parentheses. We can pass any number of arguments, but they must be separate them with a comma.
</font>
<h2>Types of arguments</h2>
<P><font size="5">There may be several types of arguments which can be passed at the time of function call.</p>

<ol>
<li>Required arguments
<li>Keyword arguments
<li>Default arguments
<li>Variable-length arguments</ol>
