<h1>if  else</h1>
<P><font size="5">Decision making is the most important aspect of almost all the programming languages. As the name implies, decision making allows us to run a particular block of code for a particular decision. Here, the decisions are made on the validity of the particular conditions. Condition checking is the backbone of decision making.

User-define functions - The user-defined functions are those define by the user to perform the specific task.
Built-in functions - The built-in functions are those functions that are pre-defined in Python.</font>
<h2>if else</h2>
<P><font size="5">The if statement is used to test a particular condition and if the condition is true, it executes a block of code known as if-block. The condition of if statement can be any valid logical expression which can be either evaluated to true or false.



<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<P>if condition:  
   <P> #block of statements   
<P>else:   
    <P>#another block of statements (else-block)  
<h2>Nested if Statement</h2>
<p><font size="5">The elif statement enables us to check multiple conditions and execute the specific block of statements depending upon the true condition among them. We can have any number of elif statements in our program depending upon our need. However, using elif is optional.

The elif statement works like an if-else-if ladder statement in C. It must be succeeded by an if statement.

<P>elif expression 3:   
   <P> # block of statements

   <P> # block of statements
