<h1>for loop</h1>
<P><font size="5">Python frequently uses the Loop to iterate over iterable objects like lists, tuples, and strings. Crossing is the most common way of emphasizing across a series, for loops are used when a section of code needs to be repeated a certain number of times. The for-circle is typically utilized on an iterable item, for example, a rundown or the in-fabricated range capability. In Python, the for Statement runs the code block each time it traverses a series of elements. On the other hand, the "while" Loop is used when a condition needs to be verified after each repetition or when a piece of code needs to be repeated indefinitely. The for Statement is opposed to this Loop.</font>

  <p>  {loop body}   
 

<h2>Nested loops</h2>
<p><font size="5">A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.

The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop"
