<h1>phython tuple</h1>
<p><font size="5">Python Tuple is used to store the sequence of immutable Python objects. The tuple is similar to lists since the value of the items stored in the list can be changed, whereas the tuple is immutable, and the value of the items stored in the tuple cannot be changed
</font>
<h2>Creating a tuple</h2>
<p><font size="5">A tuple can be written as the collection of comma-separated (,) values enclosed with the small () brackets. The parentheses are optional but it is good practice to use. A tuple can be defined as follows.</font>

<P>T1 = (101, "Peter", 22)    
<P>T2 = ("Apple", "Banana", "Orange")     
<P>T3 = 10,20,30,40,50  
  
<P>print(type(T1))  
<P>print(type(T2))  
<P>print(type(T3))  
<h2>Output:</h2>
<P>class 'tuple'
<P>class 'tuple'
<P>class 'tuple'
<h2>Python Tuple inbuilt functions</h2>

<P><font size="5">1	cmp(tuple1, tuple2)	It compares two tuples and returns true if tuple1 is greater than tuple2 otherwise false.
<P>2	len(tuple)	It calculates the length of the tuple.
<P>3	max(tuple)	It returns the maximum element of the tuple
<P>4	min(tuple)	It returns the minimum element of the tuple.
<P>5	tuple(seq)	It converts the specified sequence to the tuple.
or Python set is the collection of the unordered items. Each element in the set must be unique,</div>
