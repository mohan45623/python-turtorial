<h1>array</h1>
<P><font size="5">The Array is an idea of storing multiple items of the same type together, making it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to the base value. A combination of the arrays could save a lot of time by reducing the overall size of the code. It is used to store multiple values in a single variable. 

<h2>array reprsentation</h2>
<font size="5">
  <p>  An array can be declared in various ways and in different languages. The important points that should be considered are as follows:

The index starts with 0.
We can easily find any elements within this Array using the Index value.
The length of the Array defines the capacity to store the elements. It is written like x[100], which means the length of array x is specified by 100.</font>
 

<h2>arrray operations</h2>
<p><font size="5">
<p>Traverse - It prints all the elements one by one.
<p>Insertion - It adds an element at the given index.
<p>Deletion - It deletes an element at the given index.
<p>Search - It searches an element using the given index or by the value.
<p>Update - It updates an element at the given index

<h2>code</h2>
<P>import array as arr    
numbers = arr.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10])    
     

<p>numbers[0] = 0       
<p>print(numbers)          # Output: array('i', [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10])  
  
<p>numbers[5] = 8      
<p>print(numbers)          # Output: array('i', [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10])      
      
<p>numbers[2:5] = arr.array('i', [4, 6, 8])      
<p>print(numbers)          # Output: array('i', [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10])
