<h1>dictionary</h1>
<P><font size="5">Dictionaries are a useful data structure for storing data in Python because they are capable of imitating real-world data arrangements where a certain value exists for a given key.

The data is stored as key-value pairs using a Python dictionary.

 a lot of time by reducing the overall size of the code. It is used to store multiple values in a single variable. 

<h2>creating dictionary</h2>
<font size="5">
  <p>  Curly brackets are the simplest way to generate a Python dictionary, although there are other approaches as well. With many key-value pairs surrounded in curly brackets and a colon separating each key from its value, the dictionary can be built. (:). The following provides the syntax for defining the dictionaryfont>

<p>Dict = {"Name": "Gayle", "Age": 25}

<h2>Accessing the dictionary values
</h2>
<P>import array as arr    
numbers = arr.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10])    
     

<p>Employee = {"Name": "Dev", "Age": 20, "salary":45000,"Company":"WIPRO"}      
<p>print(type(Employee))      
<p>print("printing Employee data .... ")      
<p>print("Name : %s" %Employee["Name"])      
<p>print("Age : %d" %Employee["Age"])      
<p>print("Salary : %d" %Employee["salary"])      
<p>print("Company : %s" %Employee["Company"])

<h2> Properties of Dictionary Keys</h2>

<font size="5">
  <p>1. In the dictionary, we cannot store multiple values for the same keys. If we pass more than one value for a single key, then the value which is last assigned is considered as the value of the key.
<p>2. The key cannot belong to any mutable object in Python. Numbers, strings, or tuples can be used as the key, however mutable objects like lists cannot be used as the key in a dictionary.
