<h1>Python list</h1>
<P><font size="5">A list in Python is used to store the sequence of various types of data. Python lists are mutable type its mean we can modify its element after it created. However, Python consists of six data-types that are capable to store the sequences, but the most common and reliable type is the list.

A list can be defined as a collection of values or items of different types. The items in the list are separated with the comma (,) and enclosed with the square brackets [].

A list can be define as below

<P>L1 = ["John", 102, "USA"]    
<P>L2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]   </font>
<h2>Characteristics of Lists</h2>
<p><font size="5">The list has the following characteristics:
<ol>
<li>The lists are ordered.
<li>The element of the list can access by index.
<li>The lists are the mutable type.
<li>The lists are mutable types.
<li>A list can store the number of various elements</ol></font>
<h2>Python List Operations</H2>
<P><font size="5">
<ul>
<P>Repetition:	The repetition operator enables the list elements to be repeated multiple times
<P>Concatenation:	It concatenates the list mentioned on either side of the operator.	
<P>Membership:	It returns true if a particular item exists in a particular list otherwise false.	
<P>Iteration:	The for loop is used to iterate over the list elements.	</font>
<h2>example</h2>
<h2>Iterating a List</h2>
<P><font size="5">A list can be iterated by using a for - in loop. A simple list containing four strings, which can be iterated as follows.

<P>list = ["John", "David", "James", "Jonathan"]    
<p>for i in list:   
   <p> # The i variable will iterate over the elements of the List and contains each element in each iteration.     
    <p>print(i)  </font>
	<h2>output</h2>
<P>John
<p>David
<p>James
<p>Jonathan
<h2>Python List Built-in functions</h2>
<p><font size="5">Python provides the following built-in functions, which can be used with the lists.
<ol>
<Li>cmp(list1, list2):	It compares the elements of both the lists.
	<Li>len(list)	 :It is used to calculate the length of the list.	
	<Li>max(list)	  :It returns the maximum element of the list.	
   <Li>min(list)	  :It returns the minimum element of the list.	
	<Li>list(seq)	  :It converts any sequence to the list</ol>
